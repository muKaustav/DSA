Algorithm: Evaluation of Postfix Expression using Stack
*******************************************************

 1. Scan the Postfix string from left to right.
 2. Initialize an empty stack.
 3. Repeat steps 4 and 5 till all the characters are scanned.
 4. If the scanned character is an operand, push it onto the stack.
 5. If the scanned character is an operator (op), then pop two elements from the stack 
    and store the value in A and B respectively, calculate B op A and push it back to the stack.
 6. After all characters are scanned, we will have one element in the stack.
 7. Return top of the stack as result.
